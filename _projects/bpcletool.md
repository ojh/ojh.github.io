	- title: Project Background

		content: |
			The BPCLEtool project was commissioned by the Department of Health for the state of Victoria, Australia to:

			<ul class="check">
				<li>Help health organisations assess their performance against best practices in clinical learning environments</li>
				<li>Provide meaningful feedback and guidance to health organisations for improving their performance</li>
				<li>Equip the department of health with key data for future policy and funding decisions</li>
			</ul>

			I was engaged to help design and develop a modern web application which:

			<ul class="check">
				<li>Guides users through the quality improvement cycle - rating their performance against best practices, taking suggestions for improvements, setting and monitoring KPIs</li>
				<li>Renders meaningful reports for health organisations to understand how they are performing</li>
				<li>Provides a fast, easy way for the department of health to extract meaningful conclusions from the collected data</li>
			</ul>

	- title: The Solution
		content: |
			Working closely with [Darcy Associates](http://darcyassociates.com.au), our team developed a highly intuitive user experience.	Highlights include:

			<ul class="check">
				<li>Dividing a complex process into bite-sized steps, with each step revealed or closed as the user progresses through the tool's functionality</li>
				<li>Providing users with high-level data to reveal key trends, whilst equipping users with the capacity to drill down into data to facilitate better decision making</li>
				<li>Delivering friendly, meaningful charts to illustrate how organisations are perfoming year-on-year, or as compared to similar organisations</li>
				<li>Embedding highly contextual unobtrusive help to provide additional references where needed</li>
			</ul>

			The tool was built in an agile, iterative manner, utilising the following technologies:

			<ul class="check">
				<li>Django, Python, MySQL</li>
				<li>Javascript, JQuery, Bootstrap, SCSS</li>
				<li>Hosted on AWS, with automated deployment scripts</li>
			</ul>

	- title: My Role
		content: |
			As lead developer and project manager, I was responsible for writing the vast majority of the Python/Django code and overseeing all other development tasks, including front-end development, testing, maintenance and server administration.

			My role also included working closely with Darcy Associates and our [user interface designer](http://whoisnicoleharris.com) to determine included functionality and translate complex requirements into a friendly, accessible user experience.

	- title: Client Feedback
		content: |
			User feedback has been overwhelming positive and since launch the the tool has been adopted by hundreds of organisations across Australia.

			The department of health has likewise expressed appreciation for the "the tool's innovative functionality and user-friendly interface".
